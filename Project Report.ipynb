    "## Introduction and Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "This report is intended to explain the design and the functions of code used to create the simulations with respect to the current situation caused by covid-19. The code is designed to perform the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tGet the user to input the desire value for duration and population of the plot.\n",
    "-\tDisplay an animation with moving points which simulates the transmission of covid-19 in communities (Population model)\n",
    "-\tGenerates an animating graph in respect of the simulation and shows the rate of change of the pandemic simulation (Animation graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the simulation is to perform a microcosm of community pandemic outbreak, which emphasis on how interactions between people within a bounded area, would affect the infectious rate of covid 19.\n"

    "# Design Procedure:\n",
    "1.Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to programming code design, as the program code is expected to plot two animating simulations, a massive number of variables are required to define different features. Therefore, the program is modified and can be classified into two main class functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tPerson ()\n",
    "-\tSimulation ()\n",
    "\n",
    "The Person class focus on the micro perspective of the animation. It is used to define all behaviors and status of a person, which includes generating coordinates, infected/healthy status, movements along X/Y axis etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the Simulation class focus on the macro aspect of the animation. It includes creating the graph for the animations, defining colors for different status, and lopping an assigned array of Person class etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "With reference to the animation process of two graphs, the status generated in the Person class is fed into the ‘Personal model’ and ‘Animation graph’ synchronously. Therefore, the ‘Animation graph’ will react and plot when the dot of the ‘Personal model’ changes the color, as it is referring from the same data input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processing procedure of the ‘Personal model’ program is shown in below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThe user inputs the value for duration and population\n",
    "2.\tApply into Simulation class\n",
    "3.\tAssign the input values to instance variables \n",
    "4.\tAccording to the value of population, loop and generate the amount of ‘status/behavior’ required by referring to the Person class. Assign all generated data to a personal array.\n",
    "5.\tCompare the personal array with a color code array which include the color of different states. Assign the colors to every status generated in personal array and stored it in a status array\n",
    "6.\tLoop through the Person class again to determine whether status change is required. Update the coordinates and position of the dots.\n",
    "7.\tOutput the dots in the graph by their coordinates and status assigned to color\n",
    "8.\tThe duration variable sets the number of times required to refresh the healthy/ infected status and the movements of the dot. Repeat the above steps until the accumulated amount reach the duration value\n"

    "# 2.Graph Plot and Animation\n",
    "The python script realcovidplot.py is responsible for graphical representation of the numbers of cases during the covid-19 pandemic to visualize the rate of spread of the virus and how the introduction of vaccine affects the rate of infection and death. This was done using the pandas and matplotlib python libraries. The final output when the code is executed is an animated figure three line graphs representing cumulative numbers of infected cases, death cases and the vaccinated cases all plotted against the number of days since the beginning of the pandemic for a period of 800 days. The process of creating the graph is show in the series of steps below:\n",
    "1.\tData preparation:\n",
    "    \tImporting the data from a csv file (corona_records.csv)\n",
    "    \tCreating a pandas dataframe containing all the data from the file\n",
    "    \tExtraction of the data sets to separate pandas Series \n",
    "    \tEach series was casted to a list and assigned to a variable with a name that represents the data contained in the list\n",
    "2.\tSetting figure and subplots:\n",
    "    \tCreating a figure object and creating subplots\n",
    "    \tCreating a twin axis to add a second y axis sharing the same x axis\n",
    "    \tSetting the axes labels, title and plot style\n",
    "    \tAdding a legend to indicate the different graphs by their color\n",
    "3.\tAnimation function:\n",
    "    \tFour empty lists x,y1,y2,y3 are created.\n",
    "    \tThe animation function appends each list to add the next values to be plotted on the graph and then the values in the lists are plotted on the preset axes to create the animation frames; y1 and y3 are plotted on the first y axis against the days on the x axis and y2 is plotted on the second y axis sharing the same days axis.\n",
    "4.\tAnimation object:\n",
    "    \tThe FuncAnimation function from the matplolib.animation class is then used to iterate through the animation function and groups the frames created into a video showing the movement of the line graphs.\n",
