# FurtherProgramming-Assessment

To run this project you can either type 'python simulate.py' in the terminal to run the simulation with default
values or you can include command line arguments as so 'python simulate.py --duration=100 --population=200.
The default value for duration is 500 and the default value for population is 200.

Make sure you are running this in a terminal as animations dont work in spyder or jupyter notebooks.

You will then get two popups, one of the animation of the simulation and line plot and another with the final frame of the animation which is also saved as 'Final.png'

There is also a realcovidplot.py file which shows a covid plot using real covid data, this can be used to compare to simulation data. To run this just type 'python realcovidplot.py' in terminal, two files will then be saved in the directory called 'Vaccination effect.png' and 'simulation.png'.
