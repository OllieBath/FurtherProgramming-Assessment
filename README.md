# FurtherProgramming-Assessment

To run this project you can either type 'python simulate.py' in the terminal to run the simulation with default
values or you can include command line arguments as so 'python simulate.py --duration=100 --population=200.
The default value for duration is 500 and the default value for population is 200.


Make sure you are running this in a terminal as animations dont work in spyder or jupyter notebooks.
